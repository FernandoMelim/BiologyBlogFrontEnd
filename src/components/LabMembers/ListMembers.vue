        biography: 'Mum of 2 kids and 3 cats. Science, yoga, nature, kids, and cats crazy lover Karina is an expert in Innate Immunity.  Her scientific contributions include the demonstration of the role of NLRP3 to the control of T. cruzi infection by macrophages (doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002469) and by glial cells from CNS (https://doi.org/10.1002/JLB.4AB1118-416RR) and the description of non-conventional effector mechanisms mediated by inflammasomes to control infections such as iNOS activation (doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M110.124297), epigenetic regulation of inflammatory genes (doi.org/10.1038/srep41686), a cathepsin-mediated process of cell death (doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1305316110) and autophagy (https://doi.org/10.1002/JLB.HI1118-461R). Her lab is currently focused on the study of molecular pathways involved in the activation of inflammasomes and their impact on the control of infections. Karina is also a Hatha Vinyasa and Multidimensional Vinyasa Yoga teacher (400 YTT), and she is the creator of the #yogacomciencia #Project.',
